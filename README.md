# TLDR;

Bird image classification tool built using a trained convoluted neural network. You can view it [here](https://github.com/eliaabumanneh/BeakNet/blob/main/BeakNet_main.ipynb)

# Project Walkthrough




# Methodology

A set of [guideliens](https://github.com/eliaabumanneh/BeakNet/blob/main/guidelines.txt) were used the model creation process. Following a carefully design first trial, each subsequent model was adjusted based on its observed behaviour using the guidelines.



# Project Limitations
* Data Limitation: Due to limited computing power, the model was trained on only 15 species of birds. By leverage the power of parallel computing and cloud computing, the same model can be scaled to hundreds of bird species while remaining performant. 

* Modelling Limitation: The keras model created in this project has an overall classification accuracy of 84%. With further optimisation, the model accuracy can theoretically go up to as high as 97%.
